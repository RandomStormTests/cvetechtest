Hi Grant,

I've managed to put some more time in and produced a more complete result.  There is some outstanding work, namely retrieving offset-limited all-CVE results for a generic request, however the structure and approach is in place.  I'm also experiencing an issue with the unit-test for the web-service with an XML-response, due to the presence of &gt;-characters in the CSV data.  I could further nest the XML data if necessary, however I don't know if it would be necessary given that this is a tech test designed to evaluate my coding approach rather than actual results.

Hi Grant,

Due to family commitments - our toddler has been very unwell - and work pressures I haven't been granted time to work through the test and come up with a plan and start producing code.  As a result, I've been called away from my desk more times than I want.  As you know, that kind of disruption makes it difficult to focus and get work done with a good flow.

What you have so far is a rudimentary application that handles REST requests with a view to processing those requests.  There is more outstanding work to do.

What has been supplied so far is:

* Zend Frameworks 1.12 framework for REST response to a request
* authenticate object to grant access to username/password combination

Outstanding pieces of work are:

* context switching to be responsive to Accept-header (JSON or XML)
* retrieving the cve data for the response
* failure responses
* unit tests

I want to give myself a wide margin at present, because there's no easy way of predicting how my time will be called upon in the next few days, so I believe I should have something ready to look at by end of play Thursday.  Of course, if I complete it sooner - which is my sincere aim - then I will let you know.

Regards,

Quentin
